# EsameIATBP
Codes implemented for the exam of Introduction to the Bayesian theory of probability
The codes compute the probability of victory among 3 parties considering pollings given as input. 
There are two different versions that consider the 1 stage and 2 stages elections.
There are simpler versions that do not consider the probability of saying the truth of interviewed people.
They are not properly commented in the current version.
